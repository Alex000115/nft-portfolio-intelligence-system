# NFT Portfolio Intelligence System

A high-quality Web3 reference project designed to demonstrate how NFT portfolio
data can be analyzed, organized, and simulated across EVM-compatible blockchains
such as Ethereum, Base, Polygon, and Arbitrum.

This repository focuses on **NFT ownership tracking, metadata handling, transfer
monitoring, and portfolio analytics logic** using clean, readable, and
beginner-friendly code patterns.

## Supported Networks
- Ethereum
- Base
- Polygon
- Arbitrum

---

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate how NFT ownership can be tracked
- Show how NFT metadata can be structured and analyzed
- Simulate NFT portfolio valuation logic
- Explain NFT transfer monitoring
- Teach how NFT data flows through a Web3 system

---

## Features
- NFT ownership scanner
- Metadata formatter
- Portfolio valuation simulator
- Transfer activity tracker
- Network configuration handler
- Clean, modular reference code
- Beginner-friendly documentation

---

## Repository Structure
All files are located in the root directory for simplicity:

- `network.config.js` → Blockchain and RPC configuration
- `nft.scanner.js` → NFT ownership scanning logic
- `metadata.parser.js` → NFT metadata processing
- `portfolio.analytics.js` → Portfolio value simulation
- `transfer.monitor.js` → NFT transfer tracking
- `address.utils.js` → Wallet validation helpers
- `collection.info.js` → NFT collection metadata
- `rpc.client.js` → RPC connection handler
- `index.js` → Main reference entry file
- `nft.simulator.js` → NFT data simulation logic

---

## How It Works
1. Connects to a blockchain RPC endpoint
2. Scans for NFT ownership data
3. Reads metadata references
4. Tracks NFT transfer events
5. Simulates portfolio valuation
6. Displays structured portfolio insights

---

## Configuration
Open `network.config.js` and update:
- `NETWORK` to select your blockchain
- `WALLET_ADDRESS` to analyze an NFT portfolio

---

## Use Cases
- Learning NFT data flow
- Portfolio analytics experiments
- NFT marketplace development
- On-chain NFT research
- Web3 onboarding projects
